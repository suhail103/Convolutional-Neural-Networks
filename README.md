# Convolutional-Neural-Networks
This project compares single-layer and two-layer CNNs for text classification using the Harry Potter books. A Word2Vec embedding was pre-trained and frozen. Results show the simpler model generalized better, while the deeper model overfit, achieving lower test accuracy.
